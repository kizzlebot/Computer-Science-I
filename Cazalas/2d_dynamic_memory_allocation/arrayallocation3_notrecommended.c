// Dynamic memory allocation for an array of strings.
// In this implementation, we dynamically allocate an array of fixed-length
// strings.

// Note: I don't know if it's a limitation of C, but I haven't figured out 
//       how to get this implementation to work when you have to pass the
//       structure created back and forth between functions. That is why this
//       whole implementation is in main.
