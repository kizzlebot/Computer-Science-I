// Dynamic memory allocation for an array of strings.
// In this implementation, we dynamically allocate an array of fixed-length
// strings.

// Note: I don't know if it's a limitation of C, but I haven't figured out 
//       how to get this implementation to work when you have to pass the
//       structure created back to a function as the return type. The only
//       thing I have been able to successfully do is print out the structure
//       through a function after it's been read in.

// I finally got my readList to work, but it gives me a gazillion warnings 
// when I compile, so I am pretty sure this is NOT a good technique. It did
// work though, but that doesn't mean that it will work on another machine.

// Due to this limitation, I strongly suggest the approach taken in the file
// arrayallocation.c instead of this approach, since this approach will
// hamper your ability to create a modularized program.
